      <p>Sign Bridge is a user-friendly React.js based web application that's all about making American Sign Language (ASL) easy and fun to learn, while also offering a handy translation feature. <br />
        We designed it with a big goal in mind: to shatter language barriers and create a stronger, more inclusive bond between the deaf and hearing communities.</p>
    </div>
    <div classname="second">
      <p>At the heart of Sign Bridge is an innovative, real-time Sign Language Recognition model trained by Python ML Frameworks (Tensorflow, Mediapipe, Numpy, OpenCV). <br />
       This means you can hop onto the Webcam Quiz feature and practice your ASL signs right there and then. It's interactive, engaging, and a great way to get hands-on experience. Plus, you'll be learning in a way that sticks, thanks to the immediate feedback and fun challenges.</p>
    </div>
    <div classnmae="third">
      <p>But that's not all. Sign Bridge also doubles as a translator, bridging the gap between spoken and sign language.  <br />
      Whether you're learning ASL, teaching it, or just want to communicate more effectively with the deaf community, Sign Bridge is your go-to tool. It's more than just an app, it's a step towards a more inclusive world.</p>
